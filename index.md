## Welcome to James Menesini's GitHub Page

I'm a .NET full stack software developer with many years in the public sector for Nevada with a focus on the ASP.NET Platform. I've been involved with all stages of the software development lifecycle: from supporting/fixing legacy code bases on .NET Framework 2.0 to designing, developing, and deploying new .NET Core 6 applications using Blazor. 

I have a passion for writing code and building things customers need. But my personal goal is to always learn how to better myself and become a better IT Professional.
